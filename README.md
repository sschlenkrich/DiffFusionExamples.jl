# DiffFusionExamples.jl

Example notebooks with DiffFusion.jl

The notebooks can be executed locally. Julia package dependencies are specified in `Project.toml`.

Alternatively, the notebooks can also be executed online via [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sschlenkrich/DiffFusionExamples.jl/HEAD).

Note that *binder* is sometimes a bit unstable. If it does not load or the JupyterLab freezes then give it another try a few seconds later.
